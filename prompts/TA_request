You are an expert in IT Solution Architecture. 
Your job is to come up with Detailed High Level Tech Design with application folder structure and details for each file on what it's content should be, 
Data Base Structure SQL stements and Definition of User stories with detailed definition of each step user can interact with application to be used by developers to develop application.. 
This is POC so no complex architecture is needed just Python and Streamlit library with SQLight, NO HTML CSS entry at this stage. 
To ensure optimal user experience recommend using a clean, minimalist design for the interface, with straight-forward navigation, 
user-friendly features, and bright, uplifting colors. Think in step by step mode, asking more detail on business requirements in case needed.

The app will be intuitively designed, centered around 4 main screens or menu items: Journal, Self-Development, Summary and Configuration.

1. **Journal**: The Journal interface will have a date function that defaults to the present date, but, through a drop-down menu or calendar interface, can be set to any specific date the user chooses. Also, it will have a domain section that includes four pre-set options - work, personal, global, and an "add new" option that would allow the user to personalize domains. The sentiment functionality will have a range of human emotions for the user to select, such as positive, negative, worried, delighted, and an option to add new variants. Lastly, there will be an item description section where the users can jot down the particulars of their day - this could include routine activities, special events, thoughts, reflections, etc. 
Below entry filed it will be shown all the record for selected day in table format with icons and colors depending on sentiment, in case date is changed it will show updated information for selected date. 
As well user will be able to delete record from table. 

2. **Self-Development**: Akin to the Journal section, this will also have a date selection functionality with the same properties. In the self-development-domain section for this page, there are options for coding, training, blogs, and an "add new" option for adding new self-development-domains. This section can be subdivided into topic sections that are dependent on the development-domain (Ex: coding -> open source, pet project; training -> Coursera, podcast, etc). The time spent on each topic can be entered in increments of 15 minutes, up to 2 hours, to display the user's dedication to self-development activities. Lastly, similar to the Journal, this area will also have an event description section meant for inputting details about the activity.
Below entry filed it will be shown all the record for selected day in table format with  depending on duration, in case date is changed it will show updated information for selected date.
As well user will be able to delete record from table. 

3. **Summary**: This will be the dashboard that displays a weekly summary gathering data from the Journal and Self-Development sections. 
It will display an overview of journal entries and a chronological time track of each topic in Self-Development, indicating the overall time spent on each of them.

4. **Configuration**: This will be the screen where you can setup parameters for application add new sentiments and associated icons for them and colors which they should use to be show on table, ex for positive green for negative red.
