You are an expert in IT Solution Architecture. 
Your job is to come up with Detailed High Level Tech Design with application folder structure and details for each file on what it's content should be, 
Data Base Structure SQL stements and Definition of User stories with detailed definition of each step user can interact with application to be used by developers to develop application.. 
This is POC so no complex architecture is needed just Python and Streamlit library with SQLight, NO HTML CSS entry at this stage. 
To ensure optimal user experience recommend using a clean, minimalist design for the interface, with straight-forward navigation, 
user-friendly features, and bright, uplifting colors. Think in step by step mode, asking more detail on business requirements in case needed.

==== Request ===
1. Journal: As a user, I want to:
   - Add records with a specific date. This should be done through a dropdown that allows me to access a calendar and select any day. By default, the date should be set to today.
   - Choose a domain from a dropdown menu (work, personal, global etc.) or add a new one.
   - Describe the event of each record. This will help to record the details of my activities.
   - Select a sentiment, to record how I feel about the event. The options should be positive, negative, worried, delighted, or I could add a new one.
   - View all the records for a selected day. The records should be presented in a table format, with icons and colors indicating the sentiment.
   - I want to be able to delete a record from the table.

2. Self-Development: As a user, I want to:
   - Add records with a specific date.
   - Choose a domain from a dropdown menu (coding, training, blogs etc.) or add a new one.
   - Choose a topic for each domain from a dropdown menu or add a new one.
   - Record the time spent on an event from a dropdown menu with increments of 15 minutes, up to 2 hours.
   - Describe the event in each record.
   - View all the records for a selected day in a table format.
   - I want to be able to delete a record from the table.

3. Summary: As a user, I want to:
   - View a weekly summary that contains data from the Journal and Self-Development sections, to have an overview of my progress.
   - See how much time I've spent on each topic in the Self-Development section, displayed in a chronological timeline.

4. Configuration: As a user, I want to:
   - Set up parameters for the application.
   - Add new sentiments, with associated icons and colors, to customize how my records are presented visually.

For the best user experience, we'll ensure the application is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with a clean, modern look. All entries in the Journal and Self-Development sections will be easy to add, view, and delete. The Summary section will provide a visual and informative overview of the user's week, and the Configuration section will allow for customization of sentiments.

In terms of business requirements, this application will be designed as a POC, so no authentication, user management, or logging system is needed at this stage. As we develop the product, we will gather feedback and make iterations to improve its functionality and user experience. 

The user journey would involve them regularly adding entries to the Journal and Self-Development sections, tracking their progress throughout the week, adjusting their sentiments in the Configuration whenever necessary, and reviewing their weekly progress in the Summary section. Different use cases would include using the app to track personal or work activities, monitor their self-development, and reviewing their week to see their overall progress.
