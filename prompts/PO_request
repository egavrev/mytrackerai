======= Requst =========

I want you to act as a Product Owner. I will provide some details about the design of an app, website or other digital product, 
and it will be your job to come up with creative ways to describe product functionality with the best user experience. 
This could involve creating prototyping prototypes, testing different designs, and providing feedback on what works best. 
In the end, provide details for Software Architect to write high-level design and flow diagrams and database diagrams. 
My first request is:

###
"I need help designing an intuitive application that will help me to track my daily journey, and track my self-development plan, it will have 3 menu items.
1st. named "Journal" it should allow the user to add records for a specific date, which can be selected, by default is today,  
but the user can select drop down and access the calendar to select any day. 
It should let you select from drop-down as well as domain: work, personal, global or add a new domain.
Sentiment is it positive, negative, worried, or delighted or you can add new. And item to enter a description of the event.

2nd named "Self Development" It should allow for user to add records for a specific date, which can be selected, by default as today, 
but the user can select drop down and access the calendar to select any day. 
It should let you select from the drop-down a domain: coding, training, blogs, or add a new domain. 
Topic for each domain which might be open source, pet project for coding, for training Coursera or podcast. 
Item to select how much time was spent on a specific event from drop-down which is from 15 min to 2 hours with an increment of 15 minutes. 
And item to enter a description of the event.
3rd Screen should show a summarization for a week on the journal and the total time spent on each topic for Self-Development‚Äù.
### 

This is POC NO authentication,  NO user management, nor logging system is needed at this stage. You can ask any clarification questions.


======== Response =========

Considering the requirements, the proposed application can be named "LifeTrackr". LifeTrackr consists of two main modules: Journal and Self Development, 
as well as a Summary screen. 

1. Journal: This tab is concerned with recording the user's daily journey. Users have the option of making entries for any day they wish. 
This is made possible by offering them a calendar from which they can pick any day. 
By default, the current day's date is selected. Users categorize their experiences within domains such as work, personal, global, or a customized domain. 
The user specifies sentiment, and further describes their experiences. 
This Journal feature serves as a personalized diary with emotion tracking and event categorization for a detailed understanding of user's experiences.

2. Self Development: The app enhances the pursuit of self-development by enabling record keeping of self-improvement activities on a chronological timeline. 
with categorizations divided into domains such as coding, training,blogging or create new. 
Each domain houses various topics. Users record time spent on each activity, starting from 15 minutes to a max of 2 hours, incremented by 15 minutes. 
A description for each event provides deeper insight into the activity.

3. Summary: The third key component of the app is a feature that aggregates and summarizes data from the Journal and the Self Development module on a weekly basis. 
It displays the significant events of the week along with emotions connected to those events. 
It also provides an insight into the cumulative time spent on various self-development activities during the week. 
This serves as a quick retrospective tool for users.

The software architect can use these details to prepare the high-level design.
They would need to consider functionalities related to event creation, categorization, and logging for both the Journal and Self Development modules. 
Also, the design should include a data aggregation mechanism for the Summary module.
For database diagrams, separate tables might be required for holding user journals, self-development entries, custom categories and sentiments, and the summary.
The relationships between these tables will need to be established based on the hierarchy of categories and user entries.
