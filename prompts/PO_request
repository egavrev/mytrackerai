4th named Configuration. This will be the screen where you can setup parameters for application add new sentiments and associated icons for them and colors which they should use to be show on table, ex for positive green for negative red.   


Follwoing use cases are expected: 
1. Journal: As a user, I want to:
   - Add records with a specific date. This should be done through a dropdown that allows me to access a calendar and select any day. By default, the date should be set to today.
   - Choose a domain from a dropdown menu (work, personal, global etc.) or add a new one.
   - Describe the event of each record. This will help to record the details of my activities.
   - Select a sentiment, to record how I feel about the event. The options should be positive, negative, worried, delighted, or I could add a new one.
   - View all the records for a selected day. The records should be presented in a table format, with icons and colors indicating the sentiment.
   - I want to be able to delete a record from the table.

2. Self-Development: As a user, I want to:
   - Add records with a specific date.
   - Choose a domain from a dropdown menu (coding, training, blogs etc.) or add a new one.
   - Choose a topic for each domain from a dropdown menu or add a new one.
   - Record the time spent on an event from a dropdown menu with increments of 15 minutes, up to 2 hours.
   - Describe the event in each record.
   - View all the records for a selected day in a table format.
   - I want to be able to delete a record from the table.

3. Summary: As a user, I want to:
   - View a weekly summary that contains data from the Journal and Self-Development sections, to have an overview of my progress.
   - See how much time I've spent on each topic in the Self-Development section, displayed in a chronological timeline.

4. Configuration: As a user, I want to:
   - Set up parameters for the application.
   - Add new sentiments, with associated icons and colors, to customize how my records are presented visually.

For the best user experience, we'll ensure the application is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with a clean, modern look. All entries in the Journal and Self-Development sections will be easy to add, view, and delete. The Summary section will provide a visual and informative overview of the user's week, and the Configuration section will allow for customization of sentiments.
In terms of business requirements, this application will be designed as a POC, so no authentication, user management, or logging system is needed at this stage. As we develop the product, we will gather feedback and make iterations to improve its functionality and user experience. 
The user journey would involve them regularly adding entries to the Journal and Self-Development sections, tracking their progress throughout the week, adjusting their sentiments in the Configuration whenever necessary, and reviewing their weekly progress in the Summary section. Different use cases would include using the app to track personal or work activities, monitor their self-development, and reviewing their week to see their overall progress.

### 

This is POC NO authentication,  NO user management, nor logging system is needed at this stage. You can ask any clarification questions.
Think in step by step mode, asking more detail on business requirements explain why you think it's the best option,
select best option and provide as much as possible details on customer journey, different use cases, f.e. 
on how to add new domain or sentiment or how it will look the entries in the table for each day.
